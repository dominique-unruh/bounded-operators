# Elementary Theory of Bounded Operators
We use the proof assistant Isabelle2019 in order to formalize the elementary theory of bounded linear operators between
complex normed spaces. We use techniques from nonstandard analysis.

# Summary

Complex normed spaces
- Complex_Vector_Spaces: Elementary results about complex vector spaces.
- Complex_Inner_Product: Elementary results about complex inner product spaces.
