lemma finite_span_complete_aux:
  fixes b :: "'b::real_normed_vector" and B :: "'b set"
    and  rep :: "'basis::finite \<Rightarrow> 'b" and abs :: "'b \<Rightarrow> 'basis"
  assumes t: "type_definition rep abs B"
  assumes "finite B" and "b\<in>B" and "independent B"
  shows "\<exists>D>0. \<forall>\<psi>. norm (real_vector.representation B \<psi> b) \<le> norm \<psi> * D"
    and "complete (real_vector.span B)"

text \<open>This auxiliary lemma shows more or less the same as \<open>finite_span_representation_bounded\<close>
     \<open>finite_span_complete\<close> below (see there for an intuition about the mathematical 
     content of the lemmas. However, there is one difference: We additionally assume here
     that there is a bijection rep/abs between a finite type \<^typ>\<open>'basis\<close> and the set $B$.
     This is needed to be able to use results about euclidean spaces that are formulated w.r.t.
     the type class \<^class>\<open>finite\<close>

     Since we anyway assume that $B$ is finite, this added assumption does not make the lemma
     weaker. However, we cannot derive the existence of \<^typ>\<open>'basis\<close> inside the proof
     (HOL does not support such reasoning). Therefore we have the type \<^typ>\<open>'basis\<close> as
     an explicit assumption and remove it using @{attribute internalize_sort} after the proof.\<close>

  Assume $B$ is a finite linear independent set of vectors (in a real normed vector space).
  Let $\<alpha>^\<psi>_b$ be the coefficients of $\<psi>$ expressed as a linear combination over $B$.
  Then $\<alpha>$ is is uniformly bounded (i.e., $\lvert\alpha^\<psi>_b \leq D \lVert\psi\rVert\psi for some $D$ independent of $\<psi>,b$).

  (This also holds when $b$ is not in the span of $B$ because of the way \<open>real_vector.representation\<close>
