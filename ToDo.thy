How to use this file:

Dominique adds lemmas and definitions here that are needed by QRHL.

Jos√© can do one of the following things:
* Move them to the right theory file (and prove them)
* If they already exist (or very similar ones from which they follow trivially), add a comment here and do not edit them
* If they should be changed (the name or the formulation of the statement), add a comment here and discuss with Dominique

This way, QRHL will not be broken by the work on these lemmas/definitions
